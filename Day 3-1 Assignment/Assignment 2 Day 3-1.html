    <h3>Difference between var, let and const:</h3>
<pre>
The var is used to declare variables in a global scope but if you want to initiate variables in a block scope the let and const are used.
Another difference wit the const is, it's value which is assigned to it cannot be editited furthur in the program. 
</pre>
<script>
    var glob = 34;
    var name = "ARJUN";
    document.write("This is the name declared using var, globally - ",name);
    {
        let name = "DAVE";
        document.write("<br>This is the name which was declared using let inside the block, but it cannot be accessed outside it - ",name);
    } 
    document.write("<br>This is the name which was declared using var globally and this will show the name declared first but not the name declared in the block - ",name);

    document.write("<br>Now we shall declare a variable using const...");
    const namee = "ARJUN DAV"

    document.write("This is the variable occured - ",namee,"<br>Now if I try to edit it an error will occur.");
    namee = "ARJUN DAVE"
